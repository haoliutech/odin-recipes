<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Oyakodon is a donburi, or Japanese rice bowl dish, in which chicken, egg, sliced scallion (or sometimes regular onions), and other ingredients are all simmered together in a sauce and then served on top of a large bowl of rice. The name of the dish comes from the Japanese word for parent and child, because it uses both chicken and egg.
